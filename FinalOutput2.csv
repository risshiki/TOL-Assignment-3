5,"In a math class activity, students are trying to invent the formula to calculate the area of a square while also contrasting it with calculating the area of a rectangle and triangle. Students are given the right answer after the invent and contrast activity. What are the likely benefits student would get out of this activity of inventing and contrasting cases?",increased attention Generate their own knowledge Summarizing,"Students are likely to gain the ability to conditionalize the concept, or better understand how it applies or changes according to the scenario in a more refined way. The contrasting cases will mean that student's attention is focused on important features. Because they are participating in invent-then-tell, the students will retain the concept longer as well.","According to research findings, students will understand the deep features better, thus be better at selecting the right formula for the problem. They will perform better in late transfer tasks.",They should have a better conceptual understanding and remember it longer compared to a strictly lecture and practice method. They will also do better on transfer tasks.,1,"Benefits of this methods are (1) delayed recall, students remember the information better for longer and will be able to computer areas for longer (2) pressure transfer task/contextualizing knowledge, more students will use the right formula for area problems after the activity."
6,"The “Stable-pairing” design pattern suggests that when learners need to be paired for multiple peer tutoring sessions, for larger learning gains learners overall, they should be paired such that over long periods of time (e.g. a month), they have the same partner. The “Max-welfare” design pattern suggests that when learners need to be paired for peer-tutoring over multiple sessions, for maximizing the learning gain in each session they should be paired with the partner they are most likely to learn from in that session. If you’re designing a peer tutoring iPhone app where learners can participate in tutoring over any duration, how would you decide which pattern to use?","Since we are in online media, I would pick max-welfare. The reason is that if learners are not required to come to the same classroom by the same time, then it is very hard to ensure that learners in single pair are able to synchronise. Given that online media often assumes self-paced learning it might also be an issue (i.e. I decide to take vacation and my partner should wait till I return). In contrast, max-welfare makes decision for each session and can pick partner from those who are currently online which is very convenient.",Choose the max-welfare pattern because max-welfare would choose the stable-matching pairing if that were indeed more optimal。,"I would choose a design pattern that could yield the most gains for learners over the course of their study. Max-welfare design pattern seems to be most aligned with this goal. But most practically, I would suggest moving with stable-pairing first.","I would analyze which design pattern matches users' needs when using a smartphone, using properties that are unique to a smartphone environment. One characteristic that the digital tool has is using algorithm to make proper pairs. For that reason, I would choose to use the ""Max-welfare"" pattern over the ""stable-pairing"" pattern.",1,A/B testing to compare the two design patterns
