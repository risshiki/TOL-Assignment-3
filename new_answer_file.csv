1,"Every morning, Rajeev spends an hour alone drawing a portrait from a photograph in the day’s newspaper to improve his portraiture skills (skills drawing a portrait). Yet, despite a year of practice, his drawing skills do not seem to improved. Why might simply practicing a portrait a day not yield an improvement?",Reason could be because he didn't get corrective feedback.,"Even without deliberate practice, Rajeev could improve his skill by practice. If his skill doesn't improve at all, that is not a problem of deliberate practice, it's a problem that he didn't practice the same skill every day. He is not practicing a specific skill (draw the eye of the portrait). Although the lack of feedback is also important, it's more important to focus on the same practice)","The task of creating a portrait is a complex one and should be studied step by step rather than in full. Hence, Rajeev should identify what parts of the portrait are problematic and practice them regularly instead of drawing new full portrait every day.","lack of deliberate practice, to say, always practice a general and broad task set without pinpointing where exactly is not good.",Option1,He is not doing deliberate practice.

4,"Many teachers who have used Jigsaw report that students start to see themselves in a different light -- as more competent, likable, and positive contributors to the classroom. Does the Jigsaw method create a growth-intelligence mindset?","Yes, students are encouraged to learn , express, they are seeing others rely on themselves and see themselves improve.","No, because it doesn’t implicate how the brain works, and the malleable nature of intelligence. Jigsaw doesn't help students or teachers discover why it works, It doesn't help intelligence either.","Yes, because it gives them the confidence that they can master a concept enough to teach others and help others do well when tested on that concept.","According to the reading, Carlos changed his mindset because his groupmates think he was someone they could work with and someone they could appreciate.",Option2,"Jigsaw is about collaborative learning and empathy, but not actually about growth mindset."
