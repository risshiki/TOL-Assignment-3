Yet, despite a year of practice, his drawing skills do not seem to improved. Why might simply practicing a portrait a day not yield an improvement?", "correct": ["Reason could be because he didn't get corrective feedback."], "choices": ["Reason could be because he didn't get corrective feedback.", "Even without deliberate practice, Rajeev could improve his skill by practice. If his skill doesn't improve at all, that is not a problem of deliberate practice, it's a problem that he didn't practice the same skill every day. He is not practicing a specific skill (draw the eye of the portrait). Although the lack of feedback is also important, it's more important to focus on the same practice)", "The task of creating a portrait is a complex one and should be studied step by step rather than in full. Hence, Rajeev should identify what parts of the portrait are problematic and practice them regularly instead of drawing new full portrait every day.", "lack of deliberate practice, to say, always practice a general and broad task set without pinpointing where exactly is not good."]}, {"explanation": "The feedback needs to be given by an external agent", "question": "Dan wants to improve his golf game.
